# The Haptic Fox - Video Script (60 seconds)

## Opening (0-10s)
**[Visual: MX Console with glowing buttons, Wilber (GIMP's fox mascot) appears]**
**[Text overlay: "The Haptic Fox"]**

**Voiceover:**
"From punch cards to terminals to MX devices - I/O has evolved from transmitting bits to exchanging empathy."

## Problem & Vision (10-25s)
**[Visual: Split screen - traditional mouse/keyboard vs MX Console]**

**Voiceover:**
"Digital Twins demand new affordances. MX devices are UI virtualization brought to life - a contextual Digital Twin of your on-screen operations. But they need love to actualize their potential."

**[Visual: GIMP interface with complex selection tool]**

"Meet GIMP - 30 years of creative power, now amplified by MX."

## Solution Demo (25-45s)
**[Visual: Quick cuts of plugin in action]**

**Voiceover:**
"The Haptic Fox bridges GIMP and MX devices through MQTT pub-sub architecture."

**[Visual: Finger hovering over selection start point, haptic pulse animation]**

"Making a selection? Feel haptic feedback as you hover the starting point - precision through empathy."

**[Visual: Action Ring with GIMP tools, buttons lighting up]**

"40+ actions, custom profiles, real-time feedback - all through 2-way communication."

**[Visual: Python-fu console showing MQTT messages]**

"MQTT over WebSockets means any web app can join the conversation."

## Impact & Close (45-60s)
**[Visual: Montage of creative workflows with haptic feedback indicators]**

**Voiceover:**
"This is the hardware layer jail-breaking into the application layer. This is solidarity in the silo-breaking freedom struggle."

**[Visual: Wilber (GIMP's fox mascot) with haptic waves, MX Console glowing]**

"The Haptic Fox - where Moore's Law meets human empathy. Wilber meets MX. FOSS. Versatile. Ready to widen MX adoption."
